# Iris Flower Classification

## Overview
This project aims to classify Iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica) based on their features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The classification model is built using machine learning techniques and is trained on the famous Iris dataset.

## Installation
To use this project, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Gruhit13/ml-app.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd ml-app
   ```

3. Build the Docker image using the provided Dockerfile:

   ```
   docker build -t ml-app .
   ```

4. Run the Docker container:

   ```
   docker run -d -p 4000:80 ml-app
   ```

5. Access the application by navigating to http://localhost:4000 in your web browser.

## Usage
Once the Docker container is running, you can access the Iris flower classification application through a web interface. Simply enter the values for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, and the model will predict the species of the Iris flower.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset used in this project is a classic dataset in the field of machine learning. It contains 150 samples of Iris flowers, with 50 samples for each of the three species. The dataset is included in the project under the `data` directory.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
